As a budget-conscious solo traveler, I recently embarked on a 3-day adventure to explore the best of what Seoul has to offer without breaking the bank. From historic palaces and mountainside fortresses to trendy neighborhoods and sizzling street food, Seoul captivated me with its rich culture, friendly locals, and endless attractions. \n\nHighlights of my trip included strolling the charming alleys of Bukchon Hanok Village, hiking the picturesque trails of Bukhansan National Park, and learning about Korea's fascinating history at the DMZ and National Museum. I feasted on mouth-watering Korean dishes like bibimbap, samgyeopsal, and chimaek, all at wallet-friendly prices. Evenings were spent soaking up Seoul's electrifying energy in hip districts like Hongdae and Myeongdong.\n\nWith some savvy planning and smart choices, I discovered that a memorable solo trip to Seoul can easily be done on a modest budget of around ₩100,000 per day. Seoul truly has something for every type of traveler, and this gem of a city has definitely stolen a piece of my heart. I can't wait to return again someday to uncover more of Seoul's magic!\n\n서울 절약: 한국 수도로의 가성비 좋은 개인 여행\n\n한국의 활기찬 수도 서울은 고대 전통과 최첨단 현대성이 완벽하게 조화를 이루는 도시입니다. 저는 최근 예산을 절약하면서도 서울이 제공하는 최고의 것들을 경험하기 위해 3일 간의 모험을 떠났습니다. 역사적인 궁궐과 산속 요새부터 트렌디한 동네와 맛있는 길거리 음식까지, 서울은 그 풍부한 문화와 친절한 현지인, 그리고 끝없는 볼거리로 저를 사로잡았습니다.\n\n제 여행의 하이라이트로는 북촌한옥마을의 매력적인 골목길을 거닐고, 북한산국립공원의 아름다운 등산로를 트레킹하고, DMZ와 국립중앙박물관에서 한국의 흥미로운 역사를 배우는 것 등이 있었습니다. 저는 지갑에 부담 없는 가격으로 비빔밥, 삼겹살, 치맥 등 군침 도는 한국 음식들을 맛보았습니다. 저녁에는 홍대와 명동 같은 힙한 동네들에서 서울의 활기찬 에너지를 느꼈습니다. \n\n약간의 영리한 계획과 현명한 선택으로, 저는 하루에 약 10만원 정도의 겸손한 예산으로도 서울에서의 기억에 남을 만한 혼자 여행이 가능하다는 것을 발견했습니다. 서울은 정말 모든 유형의 여행자를 위한 것이 있으며, 이 보석 같은 도시는 분명 제 마음의 한 조각을 훔쳐갔습니다. 서울의 마법을 더 많이 찾기 위해 언젠가 다시 돌아오기를 기대합니다!\n\n---\n\n✍️ *Written by Claude agents with CrewAI — in English and Korean.*\n"
